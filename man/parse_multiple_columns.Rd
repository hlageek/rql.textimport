\title{Reconstructs text from a multi-column PDF layout.}
\usage{
parse_multiple_columns(
  text,
  num_columns = 2,
  min_gutter_width = 3,
  split_pos_tolerance = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{A single character string containing the entire text from the PDF.}

\item{num_columns}{The number of columns in the document's main layout. Defaults to 2.}

\item{min_gutter_width}{An integer specifying the minimum number of consecutive
spaces to be considered a potential column separator. Defaults to 3.}

\item{split_pos_tolerance}{An integer defining the search "window" (in characters)
around the primary detected gutter position. A larger value makes detection
more flexible and can help catch misaligned columns. A smaller value makes it
stricter. Defaults to 10.}
}
\value{
A single character string with the text correctly ordered.
Reconstructs text from a multi-column PDF layout with adjustable sensitivity.

This function takes raw text extracted from a PDF and reorders it to follow
